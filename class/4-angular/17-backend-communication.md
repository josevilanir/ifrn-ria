## Backend Communication


### Rest API Protocol

[REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rest-api-introduction/)

[In HTTP there are five methods that are commonly used in a REST-based Architecture i.e., POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations respectively. There are other methods which are less frequently used like OPTIONS and HEAD.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rest-api-introduction/)


### JSON

[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)


### JWT Authentication

[JSON Web Token, commonly referred to as JWT, is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. The token is digitally signed, ensuring its authenticity and integrity. JWTs are primarily used to authenticate users, authorize access to certain resources, and exchange information securely.](https://medium.com/@extio/understanding-json-web-tokens-jwt-a-secure-approach-to-web-authentication-f551e8d66deb)


### CORS (Be careful if Backend and Angular Frontend running in different hosts)

[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism to safely bypass the same-origin policy, that is, it allows a web page to access restricted resources from a server on a domain different than the domain that served the web page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)

[A web page may freely embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos. Certain "cross-domain" requests, notably Ajax requests, are forbidden by default by the same-origin security policy. CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. It allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)


### HTTPS (Be careful if Backend and Angular Frontend running in different hosts)

[Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It uses encryption for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)
